This directory contains the following files:

For the first part of the challenge, the synthetic data set:

  - Part1.R
  - Part1.Rmd
  - Part1.html
  - codetest_prediction.csv

For the second part of the challenge, the baby names data set:

  - Part2.R
  - Part2.Rmd
  - Part2.html
 
and two subdirs with auxiliary files:

  - css/
       /gf_small_touches.css
       /baby_names.css
    
  - scripts/
           /my_functions_baby_names.R
           /my_functions_miscellaneous.R
           /my_functions_plot.R
           /my_functions_modeling.R

The "Part1" "Part2" files are the reports:

* The html files are self-contained and should render with all figures and formatting 
  without needing anything else (e.g. the 'css' stuff).
  You can open them directly with these URLs:
     http://rapanui.rice.edu/gfossati/for_Brent/Part1.html
     http://rapanui.rice.edu/gfossati/for_Brent/Part2.html

* The *.Rmd files are Rmarkdown files doing the analysis and producing the report.  
  The contain all the code, interspersed within the report. 
  They can be compiled as they are (e.g. with 'knitr', easier from within RStudio, 
  but not necessary), except that if you wanted to do that I recommend that you
  fetch the data files stored at: http://rapanui.rice.edu/gfossati/for_Brent/my_data/
  They are pre-processed saved intermediate products to speed things up.
  The Rmd scripts are coded to read them instead of recreating them, although 
  they contain all the code to do the entire analysis and model fitting from scratch.
  I am posting also the *.R version of "pure code" tangled from the *.Rmd scripts in case
  you wanted to review the code without jumping over text and other stuff.

* The 'codetest_prediction.csv' is the 1-column 1000+1 rows file with predictions for the outcome 
  of the Test data set.
